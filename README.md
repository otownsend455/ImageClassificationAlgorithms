# ImageClassificationAlgorithms
This repository contains three image classification projects: A1, A2, and A3. 

A1 and A3 both implement k-nearest-neighbour classification algorithms, with A3 also being parallelized. A2 implements a design-tree based classification algorithm. 

Note these projects were given as assignments for my Software Tools and Systems Programming class (CSC209H) at the University of Toronto. The professors have requested to have this repository private and only accessible upon request. Furthermore, portions of the code in these projects are not developed by myself. 

Please see the README files for each project to know which functions were independently developed.
