# ImageClassificationAlgorithms
This repository contains three image classification projects: a1, a2, and a3. 

The goal amongst all three projects was to classify hand-written digits from 0 to 9. Both a1 and a3 implement k-nearest-neighbour classification algorithms. a2 implements a decision-tree based classification algorithm. a3 also involves parallelization of processes.

Note these projects were given as assignments for my Software Tools and Systems Programming class (CSC209H) at the University of Toronto. The professors have requested to have this repository remain private and only accessible upon request. Furthermore, portions of the code in these projects are not developed by myself. 

Please see the README files for each project to know which functions were independently developed.
